Welcome to GALUP's Trainings 
================

One of GALUPâ€™s objectives is to help build local capacity in applying tools
empowered by Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS)
technologies to inform and ensure sustainable land use practices.

..     **Workshop 1: Land-Use Suitability Analysis with QGIS Tools**

..     The first GALUP workshop aims at laying a foundation of core concepts and techniques used in land-use suitability analysis, of which the output will help inform land-use decision making.

..     **Workshop 3: Integrated Decision Units for Land Use Suitability Modeling**
    
..     The third GALUP workshop focuses on the creation of Integrated Decision Units (IDUs) using geoprocessing tools in QGIS. IDUs are land units, within which land properties (or attributes) are homogeneous.
